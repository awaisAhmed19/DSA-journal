EXAM STRUCTURE — 60 MINUTES
Section	Questions	Topics Covered (Confirmed)	You Attempt?
Section 1	30	Digital Logic, Microprocessors, Comp Arch (ALL DO THIS)	✅ Required
Section 2	30	C, DS, OS, Compilers – You (Software student)	✅ Required
Section 3	30	Hardware – No info, for electronics people	❌ Skip

🧩 SECTION 1 FOCUS — COMPULSORY (EASY-MEDIUM)
📌 Topics to Master:
Digital Logic Design
Flip-flops (T, D, JK), SR behavior
Boolean logic simplification
2’s complement & number representation
Microprocessors (8085)
Opcode basics, flag registers, addressing modes
Computer Architecture
Virtual memory
Memory sizing: size = 2^address_bits × word_size
Formal Method
What is Hoare logic, pre/post conditions (1 question, just concept)

👨‍💻 SECTION 2 — SOFTWARE (CORE FOR YOU)
📌 Topics to Dominate:
1. C Programming (Major weightage)
sizeof() without using sizeof (pointer arithmetic trick)
Bitwise ops: Set nth bit, toggle, check
Static vs extern vs global scope
union memory size rules
Struct memory padding/boundary alignment
Macro definitions (especially tricky ones)
Dangling pointers, memory leaks

2. Data Structures (Most weightage)
Reversing a linked list (do it blindfolded)
Tree traversals (pre/in/post)
Balanced vs Full vs Complete Binary Trees
Stack vs Queue use cases
Which DS fits best for: recursion, job scheduling, undo functionality
Sorting: Bubble, Merge, Quick — time/space complexity
Searching: Binary, Hashing basics

3. Operating Systems
User vs Kernel space
Real-time OS vs Traditional OS
Process vs Thread
Signals and interrupts
Scheduling algorithms basics (FCFS, RR, SJF)

4. Compilers
Phases of compilation
Lexical analysis
Intermediate code generation basics

🔍 INTERVIEW PREP — 25-30 MINUTES
🔥 High-Yield Interview Questions:
⚙️ C Questions
sizeof() trick without using sizeof → (int*)0 + 1
Macro to set nth bit: #define SET_BIT(x, n) ((x) | (1 << n))
extern with static conflict → Not possible, static is file-level
Union size? → Largest member decides size
Structure alignment/padding (e.g., why int after char wastes space)

🌲 Data Structures
Reverse a linked list (dry run it on paper)
What is a balanced binary tree? AVL? Red-Black?
In-order traversal gives sorted output for BST?
Space/time complexity for common operations

🖥️ OS
User space vs kernel space memory access
Real-time OS: deterministic, time-bound response
Signal vs interrupt
Page faults, segmentation, context switching

🌐 Networking
Sliding window protocol (draw the flow diagram!)
TCP vs IP (TCP = transport, reliable; IP = routing, unreliable)

💬 Bonus:
Project Talk: Be able to explain your project in 2 mins with:
Problem → Approach → Tech stack → What you did → Outcome
Add 1 challenge you overcame, and 1 thing you’d improve

Focus Zones:

C + Data Structures (60% of your success lies here)
Digital Logic & Architecture
Interview quick recall
Cisco's not looking for perfect coders. They want people who can think clearly, explain confidently, and code cleanly.
You're already doing hackathons, cybersec, and IoT. Just package that with clarity, and you’ll walk out of that room like:
“Yes. I am the candidate you're looking for.” 💼💣
