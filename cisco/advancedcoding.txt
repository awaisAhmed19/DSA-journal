Important for Cisco MCQs & coding rounds:
✅ Find common elements in three sorted arrays
✅ Closest pair in sorted array / two sorted arrays
✅ Count 1’s in a sorted binary array (binary search variant)
✅ Sort array in wave form
✅ Search in almost sorted array (binary search with nearby swaps)

🧠 Dynamic Programming (DP) – The Real MVP
You gotta own this section—they love DP:
✅ 0-1 Knapsack
✅ Matrix Chain Multiplication
✅ Longest Common Subsequence / Substring
✅ Longest Palindromic Subsequence / Substring
✅ Coin Change Problem
✅ Edit Distance
✅ Egg Dropping Puzzle
✅ Partition Problem / Subset Sum
✅ Rod Cutting
✅ Min Cost Path
✅ Fibonacci (classic DP base)
✅ Count Binary Strings Without Consecutive Ones
✅ Ugly Numbers
✅ Longest Bitonic Subsequence
✅ Max Sum Increasing Subsequence
✅ Min Jumps to End
✅ Max Size Sub-matrix with all 1s
✅ Tiling Problem
✅ Ways to reach nth stair

⚡ Tip: Cisco cares more about “can you model the problem right?” than just code.

📊 Greedy Algorithms
If they skip DP, they ask greedy. Be ready with:

✅ Fractional Knapsack
✅ Activity Selection
✅ Job Sequencing
✅ Min Time to Finish All Jobs
✅ Maximize sum of abs differences
✅ Lexicographically smallest/largest array via swaps

🔡 Misc Concepts to Know Cold
✅ Tabulation vs Memoization (DP styles)
✅ Optimal Substructure & Overlapping Subproblems
✅ How to solve a DP Problem (core idea: break, relate, memoize)
✅ Count ways to reach a score
✅ Partition into two subarrays
✅ GCD + Array Operations

🧬 Trie Data Structure
✅ Basic structure + implementation
✅ Phone directory simulation (search prefix-wise)
