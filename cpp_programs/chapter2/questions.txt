ðŸŒ± Level 1: Basics (Warm-up)
Start here to get comfy with tree fundamentals.
Build a binary tree (manual linking or via insert).
Preorder, Inorder, Postorder traversal (recursive).
Level order traversal (BFS).
Find height / depth of a tree.
Count total nodes.
Count leaf nodes.
Mirror (invert) a tree.

ðŸŒ¿ Level 2: Intermediate
Now start flexing some logic & recursion muscles.
Diameter of a binary tree.
Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA).
Maximum depth vs Minimum depth.
Check if a tree is balanced (height-balanced).
Check if a tree is symmetric.
Path sum problems (e.g., does a path exist with sum X?).
Print all root-to-leaf paths.
Convert binary tree to doubly linked list (inorder fashion).

ðŸŒ² Level 3: Binary Search Tree (BST) Focus
BSTs are must-know.
Insert into BST.
Search in BST.
Delete node from BST.
Validate if a binary tree is a BST.
Find min and max in BST.
Inorder Successor / Predecessor in BST.
Kth smallest / largest element in BST.
Range sum in BST.
Convert sorted array to BST.

ðŸŒ³ Level 4: Advanced Patterns
Time for the brain gains.
Serialize & Deserialize a binary tree.
Construct tree from preorder + inorder traversal.
Construct tree from postorder + inorder traversal.
Vertical order traversal.
Boundary traversal of a tree.
Zigzag (spiral) level order traversal.
Maximum path sum in a binary tree.
Distance between two nodes in a tree.
Flatten binary tree to linked list (LeetCode style).

ðŸŒ‹ Level 5: Expert / Interview-Killer Mode
These will separate you from casuals.
Morris Traversal (inorder without recursion/stack).
Segment Trees (range queries like sum/min/max).
Fenwick Tree / Binary Indexed Tree.
AVL Trees (rotations, balancing).
Red-Black Trees (conceptual mostly, few coding).
Trie (prefix tree for strings).
N-ary tree traversals.
Tree DP problems (e.g., maximum independent set in a tree).
Euler Tour of a tree.
Heavy-Light Decomposition (HLD).
